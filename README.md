### Summary

Ever wanted to show off your knowledge of popular songs in the industry, enjoy music, or just want to have fun for few minutes. Now you can! Introducing "Guess that Song!"

Our goal for this project is to develop a fun and dynamic real-time music game using the Spotify API.

Users can compete against other users for top rank on the scoreboard by listening and selecting the right song.

A user must guess the artist based on the song. Additionally, users will be able to select the playlists and communicate with other players in the lobby.


### Technology used:
- Spotify API
- Node.js
- Express
- SQLite
- Socket.io
- Javascript
- Google Fonts
- HTML/CSS
- Mapbox
- Heroku


### Technical challenges
- After retrieving the data from the Spotify API, we had to process it and map it to the quiz format structure.
- Styling: We had to style the content color scheme from scratch which required a lot of CSS and JavaScript.
- Spotify Playlist: Had to make sure ways for users to select playlists rather than just signing in from there accounts.
- Running time: At first, our quiz transitions would take forever. Now we were able to optimized by it.

What would we do if we had more time?
- More incorporation of multiplayer tools
- Multiple users in one game session
- Adding in playlists from user
- Add more interaction to the website
